# ZaaNet Documentation

## Introduction

ZaaNet is a decentralized WiFi sharing platform designed to allow hosts to monetize their internet connections through a secure and user-friendly system. By leveraging captive portal technology and blockchain-secured transactions, ZaaNet enables users to transform a Linux-based device, such as a laptop or Raspberry Pi, into a WiFi access point or a multifunctional hotspot. This allows anyone within range to connect to the internet via the shared network.

The platform is well-suited for creating temporary WiFi access points in various settings, such as hotel rooms, meeting rooms, or homes. Through user authentication, ZaaNet directs customers to a login page where they can enter a voucher code to gain internet access, ensuring a seamless and controlled connection process.

## Our Mission

ZaaNet aims to make internet access more accessible by empowering WiFi owners to create paid hotspots using Linux-based devices, such as laptops or Raspberry Pi units. This approach allows hosts to generate passive income while providing users with affordable and reliable connectivity.

## Key Benefits

- Zero-configuration installer for Linux-based devices
- Automatic setup of a captive portal
- Secure access control through firewall-based technology
- Integration with mobile money and card payment systems

## Current Status

ZaaNet is currently in its first phase of development, supporting payments via mobile money and credit cards. Hosts are registered on smart contracts using the Arbitrum blockchain, ensuring transparency and security. Future phases will introduce direct cryptocurrency payment options to further enhance the platform's capabilities.
